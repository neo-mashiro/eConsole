<dir>           # quick notation for a directory, such as /home/repl(absolute), repl/seasonal(relative)
<file>          # quick notation for a file, such as word.txt(relative), /home/repl/word.txt(absolute)
                # ! if there are spaces in the filename, the filename must be quoted in shell
<com>           # quick notation for a shell command, such as head
<text>          # simple text or string without quotes
<reg>           # patterns or regular expressions
<var>           # quick notation for a shell variable
<VAR>           # quick notation for an environment variable
<arg>           # command arguments
<opt>           # command options like -n -l -c...
<exp>           # logical expression

# permissions
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ls -l | head -n 10

# -rw-rw-r--, total 10 digits, leading hyphen - indicates a file
# drw-rw-r--, total 10 digits, leading d indicates a dir
# the last 9 digits represent the permissions for the (current user)/(current user group)/(other users)

# r--: read only
# rwx: full permissions to read/write/execute the file
# rw-: read/write, but not authorized to execute the file
# r-x: read/execute, but not authorized to edit the file

chmod u+x <file>  # alter file permission
u                 # The owner of the file

o                 # Everyone else (other than)
a                 # Everyone above
+                 # Add permission
-                 # Remove permission
=                 # Set permission

# u+x allows the owner to execute <file>, for example
# a+x allows anyone to execute <file>
# go-rw prevents anyone other than the owner from reading or modifying <file>

chmod 777 <file>  # set full permission on <file>, r=4, w=2, x=1ï¼Œso 777 = rwxrwxrwx

# Bash Exercise: write a program that has the following behavior:
#
# 1. when the program starts the user should be asked how many files are in the current directory.
# 2. then the user should be prompted for a guess.
# 3. If the user's answer is incorrect the user should be advised that the guess was either too low or too high.
# 4. then the user should be prompted to try to guess again.
# 5. If the user's guess is correct then they should be congratulated and the program should end.
#
# *. The program should not end until the user has entered the correct number of files in the current directory.
# *. The program should be able to be run by entering `bash xxx.sh` into the console.
# *. The program should contain at least one function, one loop, and one if statement.
# *. The program should be more than 20 lines of code but less than 50 lines of code.

: '@ nohup: run a program with SIGHUP ignored
   nohup allows a command/script (usually in background) to be running even after logout.
   by default, stdout/stderr will be redirected to ./nohup.out, unless otherwise specified.
   this is typically used to avoid terminating jobs when logging off from a remote SSH session.
   unlike a daemonized process which is meant to run forever, nohup is for a one-time single use.
